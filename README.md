# Association-Rule-Mining---UCI-Census-Adult-Data-

## Abstract: 
Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. Also known as "Census Income" dataset.
In this assignment we are using the association rule learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in given dataset AdultUCI. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in AdultUCI using some measures of interestingness.Also we are trying to find significant and strong rules contributing to the income of collected

## Objective:

Find significant and strong rules contributing to the income of collected from individuals from different countries and ages.
Find correlation between variables inthe given dataset AdultUCI.
Provide interpretations of the above chosen association rules and also discuss why you consider them interesting and significant.

## Data Set Information:

Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0))

Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.
